The pairwise similarity and subject to group solution similarity values are plotted as a heatmap and a boxplot,
respectively. Likewise, the relabeling accuracy obtained from the grouping (E) task as well as the cophenetic
correlation are plotted into a boxplot and pointplot.

The procedure is now complete and both the summary results as well as the interim data can be viewed in the project
folder.
