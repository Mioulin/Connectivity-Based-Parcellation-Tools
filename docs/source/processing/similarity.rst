Similarity
==========
The defined similarity metric is now used to calculate the pairwise similarity between all subject cluster solutions
for each requested clustering granularity *k*, resulting in a similarity matrix. The same similarity metric is then
used to calculate the similarity between each subject's cluster solution and the group level solution for each
clustering granularity *k*.
